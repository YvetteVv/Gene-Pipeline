DEPLOYMENT OF DISTRUBTION

The distribution should be copied to a location that the 'base' of the kbase R repository. The ‘base’ of a repository is a URL such as http://www.omegahat.org/R/: this must be an URL scheme that download.packages supports (which also includes ‘ftp://’ and ‘file://’, but not on most systems ‘https://’). Under that base URL there should be directory trees for one or more of the following types of package distributions:

CREATION OF DISTRIBUTION

The distribution can be thought of as a directory that has subdirectories and files. The concrete distribution will be a .tar.
