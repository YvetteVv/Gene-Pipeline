    <p>Accurate metabolic models are based on well-curated genome annotations which are labor intensive and thus highly valuable. This method permits users to construct a metabolic model of a new organism based on a previously published model in another organism rather than constructing and curating it from scratch. The proteome comparison map between the source and the target organism generated by the <a data-method-id=Òcompare_two_proteomes_genericÓ>Compare Two Proteomes</a> method method is used to identify genes encoding potentially orthologous proteins in the two organisms. The method works best when the two organisms are closely related since that allows a large fraction of annotations to be accurately transferred to the target genome. Additionally, the transferred model may suggest missing annotations in the target genome thus improving the quality of its annotation.</p>

    <p>This method uses an input metabolic model to simulate growth in a set of media conditions, with a specified set of gene knockouts, and with specified media supplements. A metabolic model can be curated using phenotypic data such as Biolog growth data or gene essentiality data generated on a specific set of media conditions. The method reports differences between growth predictions and experimentally measured growth rates. This method can be applied to test the accuracy of a model in replicating experimental observations, as well as exploring the set of metabolites that an organism can utilize as nutrient sources.  The Simulate Growth on Phenotype Data  method carries out flux balance analysis (FBA) for each medium and knockout in the phenotype dataset and displays the output (growth/no growth) as a side-by-side comparison of model predictions and experimental results. To begin, the user uploads a table of phenotype data (e.g., Biolog or gene essentiality data) into the app. The user also either uploads a metabolic model or selects a model already present in KBase. KBase uses the selected model to simulate the uploaded phenotypes, presenting simulation results in a detailed exportable report. This method also conducts some reconciliation of models with phenotype data.</p>
    
    <p>Numerous Biolog and gene essentiality datasets are available for analysis through the KBase public data sets. These “PhenotypeSet” data can be imported to your narrative by the following steps: (1) click the right arrow of the “DATA” tab in the upper right corner of teh Narrative Interface, (2) navigate to the “Public” tab, (3)select the “PhenotypeSet” in the dropdown list and search for a specific dataset (4) click the “Add” button that appears on the left of each PhenotypeSet.</p>
    
    <p>In the near future you will be able to upload your own phenotype datasets to your Narrative from an input file.  Example data input files can be <a href="http://bioseed.mcs.anl.gov/~janakae/Phenosim/">downloaded here.</a></p>
    
    <p>The columns in the phenotype files are as follows:</p>   
    <ul>
    <li>media — ID of the media condition loaded in KBase where the phenotype was observed.</li>
    <li>mediaws — Workspace where the media for the phenotype data was loaded into KBase.</li>
    <li>growth — Indication of whether or not the organism grew in the specified media with the specified knockouts. “1” means growth; “0” means no growth.</li>
    <li>geneko — List of genes knocked out in the phenotype; use “none” for wild-type phenotypes.</li>
    <li>addtlCpd — Additional media components added along with the primary media formulation.</li>
    </ul>

            Template Model
        description : |
            Models are generated based on a default template model in KBase. Template models capture the necessary biochemical information based on user-defined scope. For microbial models, KBase primarily uses two template models based on their Gram classification (Gram positive or Gram negative). These template models differ from each other by biomass composition and biochemical reaction functional associations. KBase users currently do not have the option to choose or alter the default template model.

    <p>The method merges two or more metabolic models of individual organisms resulting in a compartmentalized joint model of a community of multiple organisms.</p>
    
    <p>Community models demonstrate how metagenomic data can be used to produce a compartmentalized model of a multi-species community. As with any FBA model, this compartmentalized model can then be optimized for generation of the community biomass. In the community model generated by this method all compounds and reactions in species 1, 2, etc. are localized into their own respective compartments labelled c1, c2, etc. Compounds transported out of any of the community members to the extracellular environment are labelled e0. Any member of the community having the transport reaction capable of importing these compounds is able to utilize these extracellular compounds.</p>
 
    <p>The community model is capable of predicting the community flux profiles, trophic interactions between the community members and overall community consumption and production of nutrients.</p>
    
    <p>This method primarily requires two input parameters: (i) the list of models IDs of individual organisms (ii) relative abundances (in the same order as model IDs) of each of those organisms in the community. The relative abundance values allow one to formulate the biomass composition for the entire community. Relative abundances need to be normalized to one. For example, a four species community with equal abundances of these species is represented by 0.25; 0.25; 0.25; 0.25 in the second input field.</p>

    <p>A draft metabolic model serves as an advanced starting point for subsequent curation and gapfilling.</p> 
    
    <p>A genome-scale metabolic network of chemical reactions occurring within a living organism is primarily reconstructed from protein functional annotations originally derived from literature and subsequently propagated from genome to genome by sequence similarity. When a genome is functionally annotated, its metabolic genes are mapped onto biochemical reactions. This information is integrated with data on reaction stoichiometry, subcellular localization, biomass composition, estimation of energy requirements (directionality of reactions), and other constraints into a detailed stoichiometric model of metabolism. This model can be subsequently used for detailed analysis of the metabolic potential of the organism using constraint-based modeling approaches such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA).</p>
    
    <p>The model construction methodology in KBase is primarily based on the Model SEED framework (Henry et. al) and the RAST genome annotation pipeline (Overbeek et. al). Biochemistry data used in the model construction pipeline have been gathered from multiple published metabolic models and from public databases such as KEGG, MetaCyc, EcoCyc, Plant BioCyc, Plant Metabolic Networks, and Gramene. Currently, the biochemistry database in KBase includes more than 13,000 biochemical reactions and over 16,000 metabolic compounds. </p>
    
    <p>Once a draft model is generated, model accuracy can be improved by filling gaps in the metabolic network, known as the gapfilling process, and also through manual curation efforts. The gapfilling process (see <a data-method-id=Ògapfill_a_metabolic_modelÓ>Gapfill Metabolic Model</a>) involves adding a minimal number of reactions and compounds to make the biochemical network capable of generating biomass. This "gapfilled" version of the model can be further improved by reconciling phenotypic experimental growth data generated on different media conditions (see <a data-method-id=Òsimulate_growth_on_a_phenotype_setÓ>Simulate Growth on Phenotype Set</a>). The resulting metabolic model could be used to perform Flux Balance Analysis (see <a data-method-id=Òrun_flux_balance_analysisÓ>Run Flux Balance Analysis</a>) on a given media condition, predicting flux distributions for all biochemical reactions in the network.</p>

    <p>KBase permits the use of flux balance analysis to predict how an organism will behave metabolically in a wide range of growth conditions. With this capability, it quickly becomes important to be able to compare the flux profiles predicted by FBA side-by-side, so as to understand how an organism's behavior changes from one condition to the next, or how the behavior of two different organisms vary with in a single condition. The Compare FBA Solutions method enables this comparison. FBA solutions are compared on three levels: (i) the objective value for each FBA solution is compared; (ii) the flux through each reaction in each FBA solution is compared; and (iii) the uptake and excretion of metabolites in each FBA solution is compared. In this comparison, reaction fluxes are categorized into four possible states: not in model; no flux; forward flux; and reverse flux. Metabolite fluxes are categorized into similar states: not in model; no flux; uptake; and excretion. FBA solutions are compared based on these states, and solutions with similar states are compared based on magnitude of flux.</p>

    <p>Draft metabolic models usually have missing reactions (gaps) due to incomplete or incorrect functional genome annotations. As a result, these models are unable to generate biomass on media where the organism typically is capable of growing. Gapfilling algorithms can be used to overcome this problem. These algorithms tentatively fill metabolic gaps by identifying the minimal number of biochemical reactions to add to the draft metabolic model to enable it to produce biomass in a specified media. Gapfilling is an optimization procedure that can produce multiple solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Once a set of gapfilling solutions is successfully generated by this method, users can view these solutions. Viewing each gapfilling solution is recommended to determine the one that is most biologically plausible and best fits the physiological aspects of the given organism.</p>

    <p>This method constructs a model of how metabolites flow through the metabolic network of a microbe or a plant. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is a constraint-based approach that estimates growth-optimal fluxes through all reactions in the metabolic network, thereby making it possible to estimate the growth rate of an organism (the rate of biomass production) or the rate of production of a given metabolic output on a specified media.This method allows you to analyze the organism''s growth on different substrates and to evaluate the reactions and metabolites that carry fluxes in each growth condition.</p>
    <p>Begin by selecting the metabolic model of organism that you want to perform the Flux Balance Analysis upon. Then, specify the media on which you will grow your organism. In KBase, the media object contains the chemical compounds on which you want to analyze the growth of your organism. KBase provides users with more than 500 commonly used media conditions to use when running FBA. These media formulations can be added to your narrative by clicking the “Add Data” button, navigating to the “Public” tab, filtering for “Media” using the dropdown menu in the top left corner, and selecting a desired media type.  In addition, users can build and upload their own custom media formulations. KBase will then simulate flux balance analysis with the model, enabling a wide range of custom FBA algorithms, including flux variability analysis, knockout of all individual genes, fitting to expression data, and Probabilistic Regulation of Metabolism (PROM). This method produces an FBA object, which may be exported in Excel or SBML format.</p>
